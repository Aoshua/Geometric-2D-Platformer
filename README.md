# Geometric 2D Platformer

[Come up with a description later]

Godot version: 4.2.2

### Todo:

-   [ ] Revive ad (seems to work when on celluar data but not when on wifi)
-   [x] Idea for loader UI: same icon used for controls but with a small circle on the top that just spins until loading ends
-   [ ] Only persist coins on level completion
-   [ ] Implement some of the "ideas to make it my own"
-   [ ] Banner ad on pause screen?
-   [ ] Pause screen should hide controls

### Ideas to make it my own:

-   [ ] Animate them to still look like jello)
-   [ ] Change up the coin sprite a little
-   [ ] Allow coins to purchase different player skins other perks like temporary invincibility

### AdMob

Looking like I need to do all this ad stuff each time I export since I can't get Active Development to work, which frankly sucks. See [godot-admob-plugin documentation](https://poingstudios.github.io/godot-admob-plugin/#__tabbed_2_2) (starting at step 6).
