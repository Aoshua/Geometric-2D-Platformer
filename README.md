[Come up with a description later]

Godot version: 4.2.2

### Things to make it playable:

-   Upon death, reset level
-   Upon game completion, option to reset game
-   Persist coins collected

### Ideas to make it my own
-   Replace player sprite with a cirle with some kind of top/bottom pattern. Add rolling
-   Replace enemy sprite with yellow triangle (maybe animate them to still look like jello)
-   Change up the coin sprite a little
-   Allow coins to purchase different player skins other perks like temporary invincibility
