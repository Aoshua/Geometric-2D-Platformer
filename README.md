### Developer Notes

-   Godot version: 4.2.2

#### AdMob

Looking like I need to do all this ad stuff each time I export since I can't get Active Development to work, which frankly sucks. See [godot-admob-plugin documentation](https://poingstudios.github.io/godot-admob-plugin/#__tabbed_2_2) (starting at step 6).

##### NEXT TIME I NEED TO USE COCOAPODS:

This note is specifically for working from my personal mac mini. If you need to do anything with CocoaPods, first disable rbenv by running `rbenv shell system`. Very long story. May as well uninstall rbenv but that looks like a cluster, and I need to move on.
