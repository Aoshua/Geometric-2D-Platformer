# Geometric 2D Platformer

[Come up with a description later]

Godot version: 4.2.2

### Todo:

-   [ ] Revive ad (was working at some point)
-   [x] Idea for loader UI: same icon used for controls but with a small circle on the top that just spins until loading ends
-   [x] Persist coins collected
-   [ ] Implement some of the "ideas to make it my own"
-   [ ] Banner ad on pause screen?

### Ideas to make it my own:

-   [ ] Replace player sprite with a cirle with some kind of top/bottom pattern. Add rolling
-   [ ] Replace enemy sprite with yellow triangle (maybe animate them to still look like jello)
-   [ ] Change up the coin sprite a little
-   [ ] Allow coins to purchase different player skins other perks like temporary invincibility

### AdMob

Looking like I need to do all this ad stuff each time I export since I can't get Active Development to work, which frankly sucks. See [godot-admob-plugin documentation](https://poingstudios.github.io/godot-admob-plugin/#__tabbed_2_2) (starting at step 6).
